# Supper App
This project is a sketch city 2018 hackathon effort to help build data around single use plastic and restaurants that are environmentally friendly (or not).
You can see a live version of the idea here: https://rchillard.github.io/supper-app/index.html

# Development Opportunities
- Progressive web application to help users both record data and select restaurants that are 'clean' in that they use fewer plastic products
- Can we get a single button to contact restaurants owners and tell them what they can change (can we scrape Yelp contact info?)
- Way to automatically add Yelp review or forward to Yelp review
